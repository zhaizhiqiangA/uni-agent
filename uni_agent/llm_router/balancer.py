"""KVCAwareBalancer — top-level orchestration shell for the KVCAware router.

A **pure framework shell** (detailed_balancer.md §1): it wires Config /
Strategy / collectors, manages their lifecycle, and delegates each request to
``route()``. It contains no routing algorithm.

VeRL imports this class by FQN (``router_class``) and wraps it with
``ray.remote(...)`` at runtime, so this is a plain class — directly
constructible and unit-testable. It satisfies the ``RequestLoadBalancer``
Protocol (6 methods) via structural subtyping.
